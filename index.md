<h4 class="no-link">âžµ What is this project about?</h4>

*GMSGadget (Give Me a Script Gadget)* is a collection of JavaScript gadgets that can be used to bypass XSS mitigations such as <a target="_blank" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP">Content Security Policy</a> (CSP) and HTML sanitizers like <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify">DOMPurify</a>.

It's important to note that this is **not** a list of exploits. The gadgets listed here are either **patched** vulnerabilities or **intended** JavaScript behaviors that can be leveraged to bypass HTML restrictions.
